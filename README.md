# MARRtino face detection

## About the repo

This repository is part of the thesis project involving the robotic platform MARRtino developed by La Sapienza University of Rome. The goal of this project is making the robot navigate inside a mapped environment in order to make him take the package delivered by a postman.

Inside this repository lies the part of the project responsible for creating and training a neural network model capable of making MARRtino recognize faces (with and without masks on).
